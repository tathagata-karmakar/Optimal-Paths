# Optimal-Paths
Codes for Quantum Optimal Control of a monitored harmonic oscillator.


Eff_Op_Functions.py define all the necessary functions

Initialization.py initializes a problem and creates a directory within Data folder for the specific problem (if such directory did not exist before). Saves the number of levels, initial and final states, time array, measurement collapse timescale, maximum strength of the parametric potential, relevant simple harmonic oscillator operators.


Eff_OP_Functions.py defines all relevant functions for the simulations.
